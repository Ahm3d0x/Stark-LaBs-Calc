## üßÆ How It Works: The Calculation Logic

The calculator is built on a professional methodology that ensures all costs, both direct and indirect, are accounted for.

1.  **Material Cost:** Calculated based on the model's weight relative to the total weight and price of the filament spool.
    ```
    Material Cost = (Model Weight / Spool Weight) * Spool Price
    ```
2.  **Electricity Cost:** Determined by the printer's power consumption, print duration, and the local price per kWh.
    ```
    kWh Used = (Power Consumption (W) * Print Hours) / 1000
    Electricity Cost = kWh Used * Price per kWh
    ```
3.  **Labor Cost:** Quantifies the value of manual work (preparation, post-processing).
    ```
    Labor Cost = Labor Hours * Hourly Rate
    ```
4.  **Failed Print Buffer:** A crucial buffer that adds a percentage of the primary costs to account for potential print failures.
    ```
    Failure Cost = (Material + Electricity + Labor) * (Failure Rate / 100)
    ```
5.  **Total Cost & Final Price:** All costs are summed up, and the desired profit margin is applied to determine the final price for the customer. Additional fees (shipping, design) are then added to get the grand total.
    ```
    Total Cost = (Material + Electricity + Labor + Failure Cost)
    Final Price = Total Cost * (1 + (Profit Margin / 100))
    Grand Total = Final Price + Shipping + Design Fees + Maintenance
    ```
